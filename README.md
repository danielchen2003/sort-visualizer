# Sort Visualizer

# Requirements

1. Options for selecting different algorithms. We can generate these options in JavaScript.
   This way we can have better control over what the inputs should be.
2. Window for displaying the different values that will be sorted. This window is also where
   The sorting will be displayed.
3. Additional options 
   1. Speed adjustment
   2. Reverse the animation
   3. Slider for the amount of elements to display
4. Description under the animation window. This description would provide info about who invented
   the algorithm, how it works, and a code example.
5. The animation should highlight the elements being compared / sorted
6. The individual `divs` or other html element that will represent the bars will probably need some
   type of id to allow for  the previous step.
